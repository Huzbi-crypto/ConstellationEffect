This is a simple webpage that I worked on to improve my creative coding by making a constellation type of effect when you hover your mouse or click on the webpage.

## Instructions
- You can either `git clone` this repository and open the `index.html` file,
- Or you can go to this [website](https://constellation-effect.vercel.app/) to get a try!
